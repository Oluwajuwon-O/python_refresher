Imagine a list - not very long, not very complicated, 
just a simple list containing some integer numbers. 
Some of these numbers may be repeated, and this is the clue. 
We don't want any repetitions. We want them to be removed.

Your task is to write a program which removes all the 
number repetitions from the list. 
The goal is to have a list in which all the 
numbers appear not more than once.
